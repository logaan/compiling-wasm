# Examples

- [x] Can we export the string "Hello World" without returning it from a fn?
  - The
  [Explainer](https://github.com/WebAssembly/component-model/blob/main/design/mvp/Explainer.md#-value-definitions)
  mentions value types, but I don't see a way of expressing it in [the WIT
  definition](https://github.com/WebAssembly/component-model/blob/main/design/mvp/WIT.md)
- [ ] Write a fn that prints "Hello World" to STDOUT.
- [ ] Figure out the most idiomatic component naming scheme and do an example with that.
- [ ] Have a public function internally call a private function.
- [x] Tail call yourself until the stack blows
  - It did not (up to a billion at least)
  - It might not [this article](https://web.dev/blog/wasmgc-wasm-tail-call-optimizations-baseline) says TCO has landed.
  - [This one](https://v8.dev/blog/wasm-tail-call) goes into more detail.
  - And [this appears to be the proposal](https://github.com/WebAssembly/tail-call/blob/main/proposals/tail-call/Overview.md).
    - The code example here is almost a useable lisp
- [ ] Bundle some kind of hairy image magick transformation into a wasm component
- [ ] What does the code for working with a Wasm Component variant look like in raw wasm?
- [ ] Pass some environment functions into a wasm runtime
  - [mdn Addition example](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly/Reference/Numeric/Addition) shows how it can be done.

# Experiments

- [ ] If a language (like grain) compiles to wasm, but not wasm components how much of a hassle is it to add the component layer?
- [x] Time how long it takes to count to a billion.
  - About 2 seconds using wepl
  - 5.6s in the browser
- [ ] Can you compile wasm in a browser window and have it dynamically loaded and run?
- [ ] Can you get good stack traces?
- [ ] Can you step through with a debugger?
- [ ] Are there something like source maps?
  - wasm_of_ocaml says that there are [in the dune docs](https://dune.readthedocs.io/en/latest/wasmoo.html)

# Languages to try

- [x] Hand coded
  - 228 bytes for `add` as a component
- [x] OCaml
  - 9.7kb for hello world.
- [x] Try [Tinygo](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/go-modules)
  - 17kb
- [x] Rust
  - 21kb to return (not print) hello world with component
- [x] [Grain](http://grain-lang.org)
  - 48kb. Pulling in wasi at the moment. Possibly because we're using the run interface. Maybe there's a way to avoid that.
- [x] C
  - 49kb. For a variant example with no wasi.
- [x] Javascript
  - Produces 12mb binaries because it embeds the Spidermonkey runtime
- [x] Try [Python](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/componentize-py)
  - 34mb

# All wasm component types

The [Component Model Binary Format
Explainer](https://github.com/WebAssembly/component-model/blob/main/design/mvp/Binary.md)
lists these types.

``` ebnf

                | 0x65 t?:<valtype>?                      => (future t?)
```

Not sure what an error context is. Not sure what impact own and borrow will have.

I hadn't considered making Components first class, but if they're going to form
the basis of a module system it makes sense. Unless they can't be passed as
arguments to functions and stuff in the component spec. I'm not sure what
instances are. Resources will need to be first class.

Interfaces should also come to be part of the language. Without static type
checking they won't really be playing their regular role. Perhaps they become
the basis for polymorphism?
